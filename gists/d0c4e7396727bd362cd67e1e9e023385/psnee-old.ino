//PsNee, an open source stealth modchip for the Sony Playstation 1, usable on
//all platforms supported by Arduino, preferably ATTiny. Finally something modern!
//
/////////// TO DO: /////////////
// - Find out how the NTSC BIOS patch for SCPH-102 works and integrate it in this sketch
//   (supposedly it forces pin 15 (data 2) on the BIOS chip (IC102) low when something happens on pin 31 (address 18) according to http://problemkaputt.de/psx-spx.htm#cdromprotectionmodchips)
// - Make SCEx-arrays smaller by commoning up the common parts of the arrays and thus use less flash
// - Common up the two big for-loops with an OR-statement
////////////////////////////////
//
//PLAYSTATION 1 SECURITY - HOW IT DOES IT'S THING:
//Sony didn't really go through great lenghts to protect it's precious Playstation
//from running unauthorised software; the main security is based on a simple ASCII
//string of text that is read from a part of an original Playstation disc that cannot
//be reproduced by an ordinary PC CD burner. 
//As most of you will know, a CD is basically a very long rolled up (carrier) string in which very 
//little pits and ehm... little not-pits are embedded that represent the data stored on the disc. 
//The nifty Sony engineers did not use the pits and stuff to store the security checks for
//Playstation discs but went crazy with the rolled up carrier string. In an ordinary CD, the
//string is rolled up so that the spacing between the tracks is as equal as possible. If that
//namely is not the case, the laser itself needs to move a bit to keep track of the track and 
//reliably read the data off the disc.
//If you wonder how the laser knows when it follows the track optimally: four photodiodes, light 
//intensity measurement, difference measurements, servo. There.
//To the point: the Sony engineers decidedly "fumbled up" the track of sector 4 on a Playstation
//disc (the track was modulated in nerd-speak) so that the error correction circuit outputs a 
//recognisable signal, as the laser needs to be corrected to follow the track optimally.
//This outputted signal actually is a 250bps serial bitstream (with 1 startbit and 2 stopbits) which 
//in plain ASCII says SCEA (Sony Computer Entertainment of America), SCEE (Sony Computer Entertainment 
//of Europe) or SCEI (Sony Computer Entertainment of Japan), depending on the region of the disc inserted.
//The security thus functions not only as copy protection, but also as region protection.
//The text string from the disc is compared with the text string that is embedded in the Playstation
//hardware. When these text strings are the same, the disc is interpreted to be authentic and from
//the correct region. Bingo!
//
//HOW THE MODCHIP TRICKS THE PLAYSTATION:
//The modchip isn't all that of a complicated device: clever reverse engineers found the point on the
//Playstation motherboard that carried the text string from the disc and found a way to temporarily block 
//this signal (by grounding an input of an op-amp buffer) to be able to inject the signal from the modchip
//The modchip injects after about 1500ms the text strings SCEE SCEA SCEI on the motherboard point and stops 
//with this after about 25 seconds. Because all the possible valid region options are outputted on the
//motherboard the Playstation gets a bit confused and simply accepts the inserted disc as authentic; after all,
//one of the codes was the same as that of the Playstation hardware...
//Early modchips applied the text strings as long as there was applied power to them, whereby later Playstation
//software could detect whether a modchip was installed. This is circumvented in this application by idling the
//modchip after about 25 seconds. The text strings are only tranmitted again when the CD lid is opened and closed
//again, to enable playing multi-disc games. This is also called a stealth modchip in marketing-speak.
//
//This code is verified on an ATTiny45 with the 8MHz internal oscillator using a Saleae Logic Analyser, timing is
//reasonable important in this application.
//Kindly coded and documented by TheFrietMan, August 20 2015, The Netherlands.
//The Playstation is great but nothing beats our national pride, the Philips CDi! Cheesiness for the win!
